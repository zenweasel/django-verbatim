====================
Django Verbatim
====================

This package is really just the packaging of one template tag, verbatim, so that it can be used global in the creation
of Django project templates. After installing Django into your virtualenv, install django-verbatim and templates that
include {% verbatim %} stuff that contains template tags but shouldn't be rendered by django-admin.py {% endverbatim %}
